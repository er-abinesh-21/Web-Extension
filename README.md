# Project Title : SiteSentry - Your Personal Productivity Tracker

## Project Description :

SiteSentry is a Chrome extension designed to help you take control of your online habits and maximize your productivity. Whether you're a student, professional, or anyone looking to manage screen time effectively, SiteSentry is the perfect companion to stay focused and organized. By monitoring your online activities, blocking distracting websites, and providing insightful productivity reports, SiteSentry ensures that you stay on track to achieve your goals.

#### Key Features

1. **Time Monitoring**: SiteSentry tracks the time you spend on various websites throughout the day. With detailed insights, you can identify where your time is being allocated and make informed decisions about your browsing habits.

2. **Website Blocking**: Avoid distractions by blocking specific websites that hinder your productivity. You can customize the list of blocked websites to suit your personal needs and even set time intervals during which these sites will remain inaccessible.

3. **Daily Productivity Reports**: Gain a comprehensive view of your daily activities with automatically generated reports. These reports provide insights into the time spent on different categories of websites (e.g., social media, education, work) and help you evaluate your productivity levels.

4. **User Preferences**: Tailor the extension to your specific needs by configuring settings such as the list of distracting sites, productivity goals, and report formats. SiteSentry remembers your preferences for a seamless user experience.

5. **Secure Data Handling**: Your data privacy is our top priority. SiteSentry stores your activity data securely and ensures that your information is not shared with any third parties.

1. **Installation**: Download and install SiteSentry from the Chrome Web Store.
2. **Setup**: Configure your preferences, including blocked sites, productivity goals, and notification settings.
3. **Usage**: SiteSentry runs in the background, tracking your browsing activities and enforcing your productivity rules.
